# Figma‑Like App Scaffold

This folder provides a **starter scaffold** for building a Figma‑like design tool.  It contains a minimal React application with a Konva canvas ready for you to expand.  Because this environment cannot access the npm registry, the dependencies listed in `package.json` are not installed yet.  You can install them later in your own environment.

## Project Structure

```
figma-like-app/
  package.json       Package metadata and dependency definitions
  public/
    index.html       HTML entry point with a root element
  src/
    index.js         React bootstrap code
    App.js           Root component rendering the Canvas
    components/
      Canvas.js      Simple Konva canvas with a draggable rectangle
  README.md          This file
```

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**: When you have internet access, run `npm install` in this directory to install the packages defined in `package.json`.  This includes React, ReactDOM, Konva, React Konva and Zustand.

2. **Start the development server** (if using a bundler like webpack or Vite):

```bash
npm start
```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` or the port printed in the console.  You should see a blank canvas with a sky‑blue rectangle you can drag.

## Next Steps

This scaffold is intentionally minimal.  Here are some suggestions for how to proceed:

- **Add toolbars and panels** around the canvas for selecting shapes, colors and layers.
- **Implement zooming and panning** using the Stage’s `scale` and `position` props.  Capture wheel events to zoom centered on the cursor.
- **Manage state** with a library such as Zustand so that objects, selection state and history can be accessed from any component.
- **Create a history/undo system** by recording commands whenever objects are created, moved or deleted.
- **Introduce real‑time collaboration** by integrating a CRDT or service like Liveblocks to synchronize canvas state across users.

Feel free to modify the structure and tooling to suit your preferred development workflow (Next.js, Vite, plain React, etc.).
